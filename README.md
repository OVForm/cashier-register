Cashier Register is a simple quota feature usage tracker for Laravel Cashier subscriptions.

It helps you define static, project-level plans, and attach features that can be tracked and limited throughout the app. For example, you might want to set a limit of 5 seats per team and make it so internally. Cashier Register comes with a nice wrapper for Laravel Cashier that does that out-of-the-box.
